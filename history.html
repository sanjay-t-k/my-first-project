  <div class="balu"><b><ins>Electric Model Cars:</ins></b></div>
     <div class="bheem">The invention of the first model electric vehicle is attributed to various people.
  In 1828, the Hungarian priest and physicist Ányos Jedlik invented an early type of electric motor,
   and created a small model car powered by his new motor. Between 1832 and 1839,
   Scottish inventor Robert Anderson also invented a crude electric carriage.
    In 1835, Professor Sibrandus Stratingh of Groningen, the Netherlands and his assistant
     Christopher Becker from Germany also created a small-scale electric car, powered by non-rechargeable primary cells.<br>
     &nbsp;<br>
<video class="video1" controls src="intro5.mp4"></video>
<div class="balu1"><b><ins>Electric locomotives:</ins></b></div>
 In 1834, Vermont blacksmith Thomas Davenport built a similar contraption which operated on a short,
 circular, electrified track.[10] The first known electric locomotive was built in 1837, in Scotland by
 chemist Robert Davidson of Aberdeen. It was powered by galvanic cells (batteries). Davidson later built
  a larger locomotive named Galvani, exhibited at the Royal Scottish Society of Arts Exhibition in 1841.
  The 7,100-kilogram (7-long-ton) vehicle had two direct-drive reluctance motors, with fixed electromagnets
  acting on iron bars attached to a wooden cylinder on each axle, and simple commutators. It hauled a load of 6,
  100 kilograms (6 long tons) at 6.4 kilometres per hour (4 mph) for a distance of 2.4 km (1.5 miles).
  It was tested on the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway in September of the following year, but the limited
   power from batteries prevented its general use. It was destroyed by railway workers, who saw it as a
   threat to their security of employment.[11][12][13][14]

 A patent for the use of rails as conductors of electric current was granted in England in 1840,
  and similar patents were issued to Lilley and Colten in the United States in 1847.
   The first battery rail car was used in 1887 on the Royal Bavarian State Railways.</h5>

       <div class="bheem">
 Rechargeable batteries that provided a viable means for storing
 electricity on board a vehicle did not come into being until 1859, with
 the invention of the lead–acid battery by French physicist Gaston Planté.
 Camille Alphonse Faure, another French scientist, significantly improved the design
 of the battery in 1881; his improvements greatly increased the capacity of such batteries
 and led directly to their manufacture on an industrial scale.<br>
   &nbsp;<br>

 English inventor <ins>Thomas Parker</ins>, who was responsible for innovations such as electrifying
  the London Underground, overhead tramways in Liverpool and Birmingham, and the smokeless fuel coalite,
   built his first electric car in Wolverhampton in 1884, although the only documentation is a photograph from 1895.<br>
   &nbsp;<br>  <img class="img3" src="18902.png">
   Parker's long-held interest in the construction of more fuel-efficient vehicles led him to experiment with electric vehicles. He also may have been concerned about the malign effects smoke and pollution were having in London.[25] Production of the car was in the hands of the Elwell-Parker Company, established in 1882 for the construction and sale of electric trams. The company merged with other rivals in 1888 to form the Electric Construction Corporation; this company had a virtual monopoly on the British electric car market in the 1890s. The company manufactured the first electric 'dog cart' in 1896.<br>

  <div class="balu1"><ins><b>Golden Age:</b></ins></div>
 Interest in motor vehicles increased greatly in the late 1890s and early 1900s.
 Electric battery-powered taxis became available at the end of the 19th century.
 In London, Walter Bersey designed a fleet of such cabs and introduced them to the streets of London in 1897.
 They were soon nicknamed "Hummingbirds" due to the idiosyncratic humming noise they made.
 In the same year in New York City, the Samuel's Electric Carriage and Wagon Company began running 12 electric hansom cabs.
 &nbsp;<br>
 The company ran until 1898 with up to 62 cabs operating until it was reformed by its financiers to form
 the Electric Vehicle Company.<br>
 &nbsp;<br>

 <img class="img4" src="18904.png">
 <div class="balu1"><ins><b>Power as a service and General Vehicle:</b></ins></div>

 To overcome the limited operating range of electric vehicles, and the lack of recharging infrastructure, an exchangeable
 battery service was first proposed as early as 1896.[41] The concept was first put into practice by Hartford Electric
 Light Company through the GeVeCo battery service and initially available for electric trucks. The vehicle owner purchased
 the vehicle from General Vehicle Company (GVC, a subsidiary of the General Electric Company) without a battery and the
 electricity was purchased from Hartford Electric through an exchangeable battery. The owner paid a variable per-mile
 charge and a monthly service fee to cover the maintenance and storage of the truck. Both vehicles and batteries were
 modified to facilitate a fast battery exchange. The service was provided between 1910 and 1924 and during that period
  covered more than 6 million miles. Beginning in 1917 a similar successful service was operated in Chicago for owners
  of Milburn Wagon Company cars who also could buy the vehicle without the batteries.[41]

    <div class="bheem">
   After enjoying success at the beginning of the 20th century, the electric car began to lose
   its position in the &nbsp;automobile &nbsp;market. A &nbsp;number&nbsp; of developments&nbsp; contributed to&nbsp; this&nbsp;
    situation.
    By the 1920s an improved road infrastructure improved travel times, &nbsp;&nbsp;creating <br>a need&nbsp; for vehicles
    with a greater &nbsp;range &nbsp;than that&nbsp; offered by electric cars. <br>Worldwide&nbsp; discoveries&nbsp; of large&nbsp; petroleum
    reserves&nbsp; led &nbsp;to the&nbsp; wide &nbsp;availability&nbsp; of affordable gasoline, making gas-powered cars cheaper to
    operate over long distances. Electric cars were limited to urban use by their slow speed
     (no more than 24–32 km/h or 15–20 mph[38]) and low range (50–65 km or 30–40 miles[38]),
      and gasoline cars were now able to travel farther and faster than equivalent electrics.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      Gasoline cars also overcame much of their negatives compared to electrics, in several areas.
      Whereas ICE cars originally had to be hand-cranked to start – a difficult and sometimes dangerous
      activity – the invention of the electric starter by Charles Kettering in 1912[45] eliminated the need
      of a hand starting crank. Further, while gasoline engines are inherently noisier than electric motors,
       the invention of the muffler by Milton O. Reeves and Marshall T. Reeves in 1897 significantly reduced
       the noise to tolerable levels. Finally, the initiation of mass production of gas-powered vehicles by
       Henry Ford brought their price down.[46] By contrast, the price of similar electric vehicles continued
        to rise; by 1912, an electric car sold for almost double the price of a gasoline car.[8]<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
         <img class="img6" src="19202.png">
        Most electric car makers stopped production at some point in the 1910s. Electric vehicles became popular
         for certain applications where their limited range did not pose major problems. Forklift trucks were
          electrically powered when they were introduced by Yale in 1923.[47] In Europe, especially the United
           Kingdom, milk floats were powered by electricity, and for most of the 20th century the majority of
           the world's battery electric road vehicles were British milk floats.[48] Electric golf carts were
            produced by Lektro as early as 1954.[49] By the 1920s, the early heyday of electric cars had passed,
             and a decade later, the electric automobile industry had effectively disappeared.[50]

       Revival of interest
  In &nbsp;1959, &nbsp;American&nbsp;&nbsp;Motors&nbsp; Corporation (AMC) &nbsp;and&nbsp; Sonotone Corporation
   announced&nbsp; a&nbsp; joint &nbsp;research&nbsp; effort to &nbsp;consider&nbsp; producing an electric car
   powered by a "self-charging" battery.[51] AMC had a reputation for innovation
    in economical cars while Sonotone had technology for making sintered plate nickel-cadmium
     batteries that could be recharged rapidly and weighed less than traditional lead-acid versions.[52]
     That same year, Nu-Way Industries showed an experimental electric car with a one-piece plastic body
     that was to begin production in early 1960.[51]<br>
     &nbsp;<br>
       <img class="img7" src="19602.png">
     On 31 July 1971, an electric car received the unique distinction of becoming the first manned
      vehicle to drive on the Moon; that car was the Lunar Roving Vehicle, which was first deployed
      during the Apollo 15 mission. The "Moon buggy" was developed by Boeing and GM subsidiary Delco
      Electronics (co-founded by Kettering)[45] featured a DC drive motor in each wheel, and a pair of
      36-volt silver-zinc potassium hydroxide non-rechargeable batteries.<br>

      <img class="img2" src="19603.png">
      Most electric vehicles on the world roads were low-speed, low-range neighborhood electric vehicles (NEVs).
       Pike Research estimated there were almost 479,000 NEVs on the world roads in 2011.[66] As of July 2006,
       there were between 60,000 and 76,000 low-speed battery-powered vehicles in use in the United States, up
        from about 56,000 in 2004.[67] North America's top-selling NEV is the Global Electric Motorcars (GEM) vehicles,
         with more than 50,000 units sold worldwide by mid 2014.[68] The world's two largest NEV markets in 2011 were
          the United States, with 14,737 units sold, and France, with 2,231 units.[69] Other micro electric cars sold
          in Europe was the Kewet, since 1991, and replaced by the Buddy, launched in 2008.[70] Also the Th!nk City was
          launched in 2008 but production was halted due to financial difficulties.[71] Production restarted in Finland
           in December 2009.[72] The Th!nk was sold in several European countries and the U.S.[73][74] In June 2011 Think
           Global filed for bankruptcy and production was halted.[75] Worldwide sales reached 1,045 units by March 2011.
           [76] A total of 200,000 low-speed small electric cars were sold in China in 2013, most of which are powered by
           lead-acid batteries. These electric vehicles are not considered by the government as new energy vehicles due to
           safety and environmental concerns, and consequently, do not enjoy the same benefits as highway legal plug-in
           electric cars.[77]

  California &nbsp;electric&nbsp; car&nbsp; maker &nbsp;Tesla&nbsp; Motors &nbsp;began &nbsp;development in 2004 on the Tesla Roadster,
   which was &nbsp;first&nbsp; delivered to customers in 2008.[78] The Roadster was the first highway legal
    serial production all-electric car to use lithium-ion battery cells, and the first production
     all-electric car to &nbsp;travel more&nbsp; than 320 km (200 miles) per charge.[79] Since 2008, Tesla sold
     approximately 2,450 Roadsters in over 30 countries through December 2012.[80] Tesla sold the Roadster
      until early 2012, when its supply of Lotus Elise gliders ran out, as its contract with Lotus Cars
       for 2,500 gliders expired at the end of 2011.[81][82] Tesla stopped taking orders for the Roadster
        in the U.S. market in August 2011,[83][84] and the 2012 Tesla Roadster was sold in limited numbers
         only in Europe, Asia and Australia.<br>&nbsp;<br>
          <img class="img5" src="20002.png">
         The Mitsubishi i-MiEV was launched in Japan for fleet customers in July 2009, and for individual
         customers in April 2010,[87][88][89] followed by sales to the public in Hong Kong in May 2010, and
         Australia in July 2010 via leasing.[90][91] The i-MiEV was launched in Europe in December 2010, including
          a rebadged version sold in Europe as Peugeot iOn and Citroën C-Zero.<br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          Senior leaders at several large automakers, including Nissan and General Motors, have stated that the Roadster
           was a catalyst which demonstrated that there is pent-up consumer demand for more efficient vehicles.
            In an August 2009 edition of The New Yorker, GM vice-chairman Bob Lutz was quoted as saying, "All the
            geniuses here at General Motors kept saying lithium-ion technology is 10 years away, and Toyota agreed
            with us – and boom, along comes Tesla. So I said, 'How come some tiny little California startup, run by
            guys who know nothing about the car business, can do this, and we can't?' That was the crowbar that helped
             break up the log jam."

 The Nissan Leaf, introduced in Japan and the United States in December 2010, became the first
  modern all-electric, zero tailpipe emission five door family hatchback to be produced for
   the mass market from a major manufacturer.[102][103] As of January 2013, the Leaf is also
   available in Australia, Canada and 17 European countries.<br>

   The Better Place network was the first modern commercial deployment of the battery swapping model.
    The Renault Fluence Z.E. was the first mass production electric car enable with switchable battery
     technology and sold for the Better Place network in Israel and Denmark.[105] Better Place launched
     its first battery-swapping station in Israel, in Kiryat Ekron, near Rehovot in March 2011. The battery
      exchange process took five minutes.[106] As of December 2012, there were 17 battery switch stations
       fully operational in Denmark enabling customers to drive anywhere across the country in an electric
       car.[107] By late 2012 the company began to suffer financial difficulties, and decided to put on hold
        the roll out in Australia and reduce its non-core activities in North America, as the company decided
        to concentrate its resources on its two existing markets.[108][109][110] On 26 May 2013, Better Place
        filed for bankruptcy in Israel.[111] The company's financial difficulties were caused by the high
         investment required to develop the charging and swapping infrastructure, about US$850 million in
         private capital, and a market penetration significantly lower than originally predicted by Shai Agassi.
          Less than 1,000 Fluence Z.E. cars were deployed in Israel and around 400 units in Denmark.<br>

          As of June 2014, there were over 500,000 plug-in electric passenger cars and utility vans
           in the world, with the U.S. leading plug-in electric car sales with a 45% share of global
            sales.[135][136] In September 2014, sales of plug-in electric cars in the United States
            reached the 250,000 unit milestone.[137] Global cumulative sales of the Tesla Model S passed
            the 50,000 unit milestone in October 2014.[138] In November 2014 the Renault–Nissan Alliance
             reached 200,000 all-electric vehicles delivered globally, representing a 58% share of the global
              light-duty all-electric market segment.<br>

              The Tesla Model 3 surpassed the Nissan Leaf in early
              2020 to become the world's best selling electric car ever, with more than 500,000 total
               units sold by March 2020.[194] However, the Tesla Model Y is the bestselling electric vehicle
               in terms of yearly units.[208] Tesla also became the first auto manufacturer to produce 1 million
               electric cars in March 2020.[209] Global sales of the Model 3 passed the 1 million milestone in June
               2021, the first electric car model to do so.[210]
