   Rechargeable batteries that provided a viable means for storing
   electricity on board a vehicle did not come into being until 1859, with
   the invention of the lead–acid battery by French physicist Gaston Planté.
    Camille Alphonse Faure, another French scientist, significantly improved the design
    of the battery in 1881; his improvements greatly increased the capacity of such batteries
    and led directly to their manufacture on an industrial scale.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>

    English inventor <ins>Thomas Parker</ins>, who was responsible for innovations such as electrifying
     the London Underground, overhead tramways in Liverpool and Birmingham, and the smokeless fuel coalite,
      built his first electric car in Wolverhampton in 1884, although the only documentation is a photograph from 1895.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>  <img class="img3" src="18902.png">
      Parker's long-held interest in the construction of more fuel-efficient vehicles led him to experiment with electric vehicles. He also may have been concerned about the malign effects smoke and pollution were having in London.[25] Production of the car was in the hands of the Elwell-Parker Company, established in 1882 for the construction and sale of electric trams. The company merged with other rivals in 1888 to form the Electric Construction Corporation; this company had a virtual monopoly on the British electric car market in the 1890s. The company manufactured the first electric 'dog cart' in 1896.<br>

     <div class="balu1"><ins><b>Golden Age:</b></ins></div>
Interest in motor vehicles increased greatly in the late 1890s and early 1900s.
Electric battery-powered taxis became available at the end of the 19th century.
In London, Walter Bersey designed a fleet of such cabs and introduced them to the streets of London in 1897.
 They were soon nicknamed "Hummingbirds" due to the idiosyncratic humming noise they made.
 In the same year in New York City, the Samuel's Electric Carriage and Wagon Company began running 12 electric hansom cabs.
 &nbsp;<br>
 The company ran until 1898 with up to 62 cabs operating until it was reformed by its financiers to form
  the Electric Vehicle Company.<br>
  &nbsp;<br>

   <div class="balu1"><ins><b>Power as a service and General Vehicle:</b></ins></div>

To overcome the limited operating range of electric vehicles, and the lack of recharging infrastructure, an exchangeable
 battery service was first proposed as early as 1896.[41] The concept was first put into practice by Hartford Electric
  Light Company through the GeVeCo battery service and initially available for electric trucks. The vehicle owner purchased
   the vehicle from General Vehicle Company (GVC, a subsidiary of the General Electric Company) without a battery and the
    electricity was purchased from Hartford Electric through an exchangeable battery. The owner paid a variable per-mile
    charge and a monthly service fee to cover the maintenance and storage of the truck. Both vehicles and batteries were
    modified to facilitate a fast battery exchange. The service was provided between 1910 and 1924 and during that period
     covered more than 6 million miles. Beginning in 1917 a similar successful service was operated in Chicago for owners
     of Milburn Wagon Company cars who also could buy the vehicle without the batteries.[41]
