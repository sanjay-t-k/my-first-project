     Revival of interest
In &nbsp;1959, &nbsp;American&nbsp;&nbsp;Motors&nbsp; Corporation (AMC) &nbsp;and&nbsp; Sonotone Corporation
 announced&nbsp; a&nbsp; joint &nbsp;research&nbsp; effort to &nbsp;consider&nbsp; producing an electric car
 powered by a "self-charging" battery.[51] AMC had a reputation for innovation
  in economical cars while Sonotone had technology for making sintered plate nickel-cadmium
   batteries that could be recharged rapidly and weighed less than traditional lead-acid versions.[52]
   That same year, Nu-Way Industries showed an experimental electric car with a one-piece plastic body
   that was to begin production in early 1960.[51]<br>
   &nbsp;<br>
     <img class="img7" src="19602.png">
   On 31 July 1971, an electric car received the unique distinction of becoming the first manned
    vehicle to drive on the Moon; that car was the Lunar Roving Vehicle, which was first deployed
    during the Apollo 15 mission. The "Moon buggy" was developed by Boeing and GM subsidiary Delco
    Electronics (co-founded by Kettering)[45] featured a DC drive motor in each wheel, and a pair of
    36-volt silver-zinc potassium hydroxide non-rechargeable batteries.<br>

    Most electric vehicles on the world roads were low-speed, low-range neighborhood electric vehicles (NEVs).
     Pike Research estimated there were almost 479,000 NEVs on the world roads in 2011.[66] As of July 2006,
     there were between 60,000 and 76,000 low-speed battery-powered vehicles in use in the United States, up
      from about 56,000 in 2004.[67] North America's top-selling NEV is the Global Electric Motorcars (GEM) vehicles,
       with more than 50,000 units sold worldwide by mid 2014.[68] The world's two largest NEV markets in 2011 were
        the United States, with 14,737 units sold, and France, with 2,231 units.[69] Other micro electric cars sold
        in Europe was the Kewet, since 1991, and replaced by the Buddy, launched in 2008.[70] Also the Th!nk City was
        launched in 2008 but production was halted due to financial difficulties.[71] Production restarted in Finland
         in December 2009.[72] The Th!nk was sold in several European countries and the U.S.[73][74] In June 2011 Think
         Global filed for bankruptcy and production was halted.[75] Worldwide sales reached 1,045 units by March 2011.
         [76] A total of 200,000 low-speed small electric cars were sold in China in 2013, most of which are powered by
         lead-acid batteries. These electric vehicles are not considered by the government as new energy vehicles due to
         safety and environmental concerns, and consequently, do not enjoy the same benefits as highway legal plug-in
         electric cars.[77]
